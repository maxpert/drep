Each line of the filters file is an expression that starts with ~, =, !=, or !~
The matches will be done in the order they appear and if anything matches it's piped to stdout right away

Any line that starts with `!~` implies does not match regex, e.g:
!~"time": \d+.\d{0,2}

Any line that starts with ~ implies match regex, e.g:
~"time": \d+.\d{3,}

Any line that starts with `!=` implies does not contain text, e.g:
!=INFO

Any line that starts with `=` implies contain text, e.g:
="total-duration"

Everything else is ignored, as you can see from plain text.
